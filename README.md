# Currency-Converter

This application uses the Python response module to take live data from http://www.floatrates.com/ in order to exchange user inputed currency. The user will input what currency they have to exchange, the amount they want to exchange, and the currency they want to exchange to. A response will be received and the output will be the amount of currency they are able to exchange at current rate.
